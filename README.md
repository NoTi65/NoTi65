- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @NoTi65
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in PERL-Scripting to Login to Poloniex API for executing Private Commands  at  my Raspberry PI.
but there are still errors while executing that script. 
I have tested 4 Variations of executing a Private Command  (see attachment)- but script shows http error code 403 (Forbidden)
I have to experience in JAVA etc - so i need help for my PERL-Script..
Any help appreciated because existing examples at https://github.com/poloniex/polo-spot-sdk/tree/BRANCH_SANDBOX/signature_demo
are not helpful for me.
